## Description-Of-Code

* The goal of this project was to create a simple daily planner that updates colors as time progresses. The green columns will designate future time blocks, the red designation will represent the current time period, and any column that remains grey will be labeled as past time periods no longer available. Code will be adjusted so anything saved inside the columns will be saved in local storage and remain until the user deletes . The current date will also display at the top of the page. And the save button at the end of the columns will function correctly.
